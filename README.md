Based on my positive experiences with my other project [BattleSub](https://github.com/bfeldpw/battlesub) with [Magnum](https://github.com/mosra/magnum) and [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) I decided to restart my favorite project [Planeworld](https://github.com/planeworld/planeworld) by consequently using a client server mechanic, an ECS (EnTT) and a graphics (and much more) middleware (Magnum Graphics). While the server component doesn't rely on a graphical interface, check out Magnum Graphics used by the desktop client, too.
